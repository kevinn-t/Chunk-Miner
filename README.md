Directions:
The turtle's position in respect to the chunk will determine its orientation.
For the following corners:

NW, turtle faces WEST
NE, turtle faces SOUTH
SW, turtle faces NORTH
SE, turtle faces EAST

*Start by simply placing Timothee in the "bottom left" corner of the chunk (relative to the
player), facing forward.

Process:
Starting on the corner its placed, it digs out the block below it before digging out blocks below 
it in a straight line ahead of it; digging out a "lane". Once it reaches the opposite edge of the 
chunk, it goes to the next lane to the right, digging it out. Timothee continues this in a snake-
like pattern until it has dug out a layer. It then goes down a block and continues to dig (again)
in a snake-like pattern going the other direction. Continuing this cycle until it has reached 
bedrock, filled its inventory, or run low on fuel. 

Once Timothee runs low on fuel, it **SHOULD** return to the docking station to refuel and deposit
the items it's mined. Lil' Tim automatically fuels up using coal / other burnable items it mines, 
which isn't enough to keep it fueled all the way to bedrock, so keep the fuel input stocked.
